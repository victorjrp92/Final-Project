## **Project Description: Finding the Best Location for Interrapidisimo in Cali, Colombia**

This project seeks to find the best possible location for a delivery company franchise in Cali, Colombia named Interrapidisimo. The goal is to find a location that is strategically placed in a busy area, close to potential customers, and with little competition. To accomplish this, the project will investigate various data sources, including Google Maps API, to obtain information on the city's demographics, population growth trends, and competitor locations.

Based on the data analysis, the project will produce a set of recommendations for the best possible location for Interrapidisimo in Cali. Prospective business owners, such as myself, who are interested in opening a franchise in the city, can use this information.

To find the best possible location for the franchise, we must examine a variety of factors that are likely to influence the company's success. The following are the tasks that we will try to complete in order to find the best possible location:

- Analyze the delivery companies' competitors in Cali to identify areas with high foot traffic and a large customer base. This will help us identify locations where Interrapidisimo can attract more customers and potentially gain a competitive advantage.

- Look for locations that are easily accessible by car, bike, or public transportation, and that are located near main roads or transportation hubs. This will help ensure that customers can easily access the location and improve the overall convenience of the service.

- Consider population growth trends in different areas of Cali to identify locations with increasing demand for delivery services. This will help us identify areas where there is potential for the business to grow and expand.

- Identify the busiest times of the day for delivery companies in Cali. By doing so, we can optimize the business's operations and ensure that we are staffed appropriately to handle high demand.

- Determine whether Interrapidisimo is the only company of its kind in the area. If we can identify locations with no or few competitors, this could provide a significant advantage in terms of market share and profitability.

- Analyze the performance of other stores in the same franchise by taking the top 10 from Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and finding out what they have in common that makes them perform well. This will help us identify the key factors that contribute to the success of the franchise and potentially replicate them in our location.

- Analyze the demographics of different areas in Cali to determine which areas are most likely to have a high demand for delivery services. This will include factors such as income level, age distribution, and education level.
